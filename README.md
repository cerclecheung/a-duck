‘Aduck’ is a virtual reality game project built on[A-Frame](https://aframe.io) and React with [aframe-react](https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-react).

While wearing the VRheadset, the player rubber duck, cruises the runway by head rotation and everytime it meets another rubber duck, the score increases.
